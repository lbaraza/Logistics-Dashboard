# Data Analysis Tool for Client and Carrier OTIF Performance

# Overview
This project involves the development of a data analysis tool designed to analyze and present the On-Time In-Full (OTIF) performance of both clients and carriers.
The primary goal is to provide valuable insights that can drive continuous improvement and enhance customer experience. 
The tool is built using Power BI,leveraging its powerful data visualization and DAX capabilities to create comprehensive measures and dashboards.

# Goals
1. Identify Carriers' OTIF Performance:
- Develop comprehensive reports and visualizations to present carriers' OTIF performance to managers.
- Enable managers to make data-driven decisions to optimize carrier selection and logistics operations.
2. Check the 5 Worst OTIF Accomplishments for Clients:
- Identify the clients with the 5 worst OTIF performance metrics.
- Create action plans for continuous improvement to immediately enhance their customer experience.
- Facilitate targeted interventions to improve the overall satisfaction of these key clients.
3. Identify Clients' OTIF Performance:
- Provide detailed analysis of each client's OTIF performance.

# Tools And Technologies
- Power BI: The primary tool used for data visualization and analysis. Power BI allows us to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide in-depth insights into OTIF performance.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized extensively to create measures and calculations necessary for the detailed analysis required for this project.

# Features
- Logistics Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard that delves deep into OTIF metrics.
- Carrier Performance Analysis: Visualizations and metrics to track and assess the OTIF performance of various carriers.
- Client Performance Analysis: Detailed views of client OTIF performance, highlighting the top and bottom performers.
- Worst Performers Identification: Specific focus on identifying the 5 clients with the worst OTIF performance, facilitating targeted improvement actions.
# DAX Measures and Calculations
The project involves mastering DAX to create complex measures that drive the insights presented in the dashboards. Some of the key DAX measures include:
- OTIF Percentage Calculations
- Performance Ranking for Carriers and Clients
- Trend Analysis Over Time
- Comparative Analysis Between Different Carriers and Clients
# Usage
To use the data analysis tool, follow these steps:

1. - Data Preparation: Ensure the data is collected and cleaned, ready to be imported into Power BI.
2. - Import Data: Load the data into Power BI.
3. - Dashboard Interaction: Use the interactive features of the dashboard to explore the OTIF performance insights.
4. Action Plans: Based on the insights, develop and implement action plans to address areas needing improvement.
# Conclusion
This data analysis tool is designed to provide a deep understanding of OTIF performance for both clients and carriers. By leveraging Power BI and DAX, we can present detailed and actionable insights that drive continuous improvement and enhance customer experience
