# Data Analysis Tool for Client and Carrier OTIF Performance

# Overview
This project involves the development of a data analysis tool designed to analyze and present the On-Time In-Full (OTIF) performance of both clients and carriers.
The primary goal is to provide valuable insights that can drive continuous improvement and enhance customer experience related to delivery. 
The tool is built using Power BI,leveraging its powerful data visualization and DAX capabilities to create comprehensive measures and dashboards.

# Goals
1. Identify Carriers' OTIF Performance:
- Develop comprehensive reports and visualizations to present carriers' OTIF performance to managers.
- Enable managers to make data-driven decisions to optimize carrier selection and logistics operations.
2. Check the 5 Worst OTIF Accomplishments for Clients:
- Identify the clients with the 5 worst OTIF performance metrics.
- Create action plans for continuous improvement to immediately enhance their customer experience.
- Facilitate targeted interventions to improve the overall satisfaction of these key clients.
3. Identify Clients' OTIF Performance:
- Provide detailed analysis of each client's OTIF performance.
4. Improve OTIF visibility:
- Provide a clear view of carrier and client OTIF performance to track service levels and identify trends.

# Key Findings
Service Level Performance Improvement:
- Intial OTIF Performance:85%(before dashboard implementation)
- Target OTIF Performance:95%(set as a company goal)
- Current OTIF Performance:92%(after implementing the dashboard)
This indicates a 7% improvement in overall service level after using the dashboard to monitor and optimize carrier and client performance.
The increase in OTIF directly translates to better on-time and complete deliveries,enhancing customer satisfacton and minimizing operational disruptions.

# Tools And Technologies
- Power BI: The primary tool used for data visualization and analysis. Power BI allows us to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide in-depth insights into OTIF performance.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized extensively to create measures and calculations necessary for the detailed analysis required for this project.

# DAX Measures and Calculations
The project involves mastering DAX to create complex measures that drive the insights presented in the dashboards. Some of the key DAX measures include:
- OTIF Percentage Calculations
- Performance Ranking for Carriers and Clients
- Trend Analysis Over Time
- Comparative Analysis Between Different Carriers and Clients
- OTIF percentage improvements
